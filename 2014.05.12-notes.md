Short Questions
---------------

1. What conditions cause a thread to move between each of the three stats in a preemptive CPU scheduler?

	1. ready->running: when the scheduler picks it up
	2. running->ready: when it yields or interrupted
	3. blocked->ready: when a shared resource becomes available
	4. ready->blocked: N/A
	5. running->blocked: when waiting for a shared resource
	6. blocked->running: N/A

2. To guarantee no deadlock, it is sufficient to negate just one of the four conditions that contribute to deadlock. (TRUE)

	- Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode.[1] Only one process can use the resource at any given instant of time.
	- Hold and Wait or Resource Holding: A process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes.
	- No Preemption: The operating system must not de-allocate resources once they have been allocated; they must be released by the holding process voluntarily.
	- Circular Wait: A process must be waiting for a resource which is being held by another process, which in turn is waiting for the first process to release the resource. In general, there 

3. What is the biggest disadvantage of implementing threads in user space? What is the biggest advantage? (One sentence each.) (2 pts)

	- Avantage: context switching is fast, because it's all in the same user space
	- Disadvantage: (1) have to implement threading in user library; (2) if one thread blocks, all threads block

4. List two advantages of preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm over a non-preemtive one?

	- Better response times (illusion of multi-tasking)
	- Less starvation and not dependent on jobs yielding
	- Better CPU/IO parallelism

5. Jay Z is using a system that has kernel threads but only one processor. JZ writes an application and decides to schedule: FAILS

6. A UNIX file system has 2-KB blocks

	2000 / 4 = 500

	10 blocks
	500 blocks
	500*500 blocks

10. True/False/Why? False: lock order can't be detected at compile-time.
