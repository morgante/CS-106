IO is keyboard input, output, etc. 
When a process is waiting for IO, let the CPU work on a different process. (IO Parallelism)

# Context switch
Storing state before switch:
- All registers are stored
- Memory is part of state
	- If we have no memory protection, need to save all of it
	- If we have protection, can save less

State is everthing the process needs to resume execution.
